We, the undersigned, are declaring a breakdown in the world of Agile
      and Scrum. We love the four values and twelve principles of the
      Agile Manifesto. We may have been inspired by Ken Schwaber's
      description of Scrum.  But we feel that today these
      words have become distorted to mean the opposite of their
      original intent.

We like less process, fewer layers, fewer roles, reduced use of "Agile
tools" like JIRA, less traditional managment in disguise, less hype,
and less "hyperproductivity."  We believe that traditional
organizations will not gain agility with these superficial changes,
and that what's often sold may actually be counterproductive.
Organizations that want to truly serve their customers and employees
will benefit more from _de-scaling organizational complexity_, and
instead increasing skills, knowledge, and collaboration.  This
involves changes to organizational structure and policy, with farther
reaching implications than many will admit.

Thus we are hopeful that LeSS (and maybe even Nexus) represents a
much needed course correction in our industry.
