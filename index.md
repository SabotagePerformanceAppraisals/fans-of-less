# We Object To The Rampant Distortion Of Agile And Scrum.

We, the undersigned, are calling B.S. on what is usually sold as Agile
and Scrum. We love the [four values](https://agilemanifesto.org) and
[twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of the
Agile Manifesto, the original reason our movement was called *Agile*.
Some of us were also inspired by
[a realistic and useful vision of Scrum](a-realistic-and-useful-vision-of-scrum/).
But we feel that _Agile_ and _Scrum_ are usually distorted to mean
something incompatible with this prior intent, especially when applied
to organizations that are bigger than one team.

We believe in the competitive advantage of adaptability in order to
  discover and deliver on the highest end-customer value in a complex
  and turbulent environment rather than continuing to turn the screws
  on speed and resource efficiency. 

We believe that even when many team are involved, adaptability of
 customer value can be fine-grained and on a timescale of a week to a
 month rather than limited to coarse multi-month program increments
 and quarterly goals.
 
We believe in the many advantages of structuring teams around
  customer features and eliminating planning-time dependencies rather
  than components in the technology architecture and continuing
  batched planning with overlapping waterfall lifecycles to manage
  dependencies that could be eliminated.
  
We believe in the adaptability advantages of a simplified,
  disintermediated organizational structure such that teams
  coordinate directly other teams and learn directly from customer
  interaction rather than rebadging the specifiers and coordinators.
  
We believe in a true cooperative game involving business
  stakeholders and development rather than fixed incremental
  development within "The Contract Game" based on a scope and date
  contract born out of opposing interests.
  
We believe in self-managing teams that own (not rent) their own
  processes and tools within agreed boundaries of interaction and
  transparency rather than being forced to conform to work management
  tools that impose processes on teams.

Saying *yes* to real agility means saying *no* to things that are
often mischaracterized as Agile: 
* eliminate processes not owned by teams,
* eliminate unnecessary intermediate layers and handoffs, (e.g. [people
  mislabeled "Product Owners" who actually own only one team instead of the
  whole Product](https://seattlescrum.com/downloads/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Organization-Very-Agile-Product-Owner-Misconceptions.pdf)) 
* eliminate unnecessary process-imposed role distinctions (e.g. Release
  Train Engineer, Scrum Master as crypto-project-manager rather than
  organizational change agents) 
* eliminate software tools that affect the way teams manage their
Product Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs,
* eliminate the obsession with quantitative measures, particularly
  "velocity,"
* eliminate other traditional management practices relabeled and
  disguised as "Agile."

We believe that traditional organizations will not gain agility with
the superficial _change theater_ that is often sold as "Agile."  We
find change theater to be actively counterproductive, innoculating
organizations against the deeper, more fundamental changes they would
need.

Organizations that want to truly serve their customers and employees
will benefit more from _de-scaling organizational complexity_, and
instead increasing skills, knowledge, and collaboration.  This
involves fundamental changes to organizational structure and policy
led both from the top and the bottom, with farther reaching
implications and a tougher journey than many will expect.

For these reasons we support approaches such as LeSS that are based on
fundamental Agile principles, and we reject 'scaling' approaches that
increase organizational complexity and disempower teams.
