# Fans Of LeSS Declaration

We, the undersigned, are declaring a breakdown in the world of Agile
      and Scrum. We love the four values and twelve principles of the
      Agile Manifesto. We may have been inspired by Ken Schwaber's
      description of Scrum.  But we feel that today these
      words have become distorted to mean the opposite of their
      original intent.

We believe that traditional
organizations will not gain agility with the superficial _change theater_ that
is often sold as "Agile."   Instead we advocate less process, fewer layers,
fewer roles, reduced use of "Agile tools" such as JIRA, less focus on
metrics, less traditional managment in disguise, and less 
hype.  We find this stuff to be actively
_counterproductive_, innoculating organizations against real change.

Organizations that want to truly serve their customers and employees
will benefit more from _de-scaling organizational complexity_, and
instead increasing skills, knowledge, and collaboration.  This
involves fundamental changes to organizational structure and policy
led both from the top and the bottom, with farther reaching
implications and a longer journey than many will expect. 

Thus we feel that lesser-known approaches that are explicit about this, such
as LeSS (and maybe even Nexus) represent a much needed change in our
industry.
