# We Object To The Rampant Distortion Of Agile And Scrum.

We are calling B.S. on what is usually sold as Agile
and Scrum. We love the [four values](https://agilemanifesto.org){:target="_blank"} and
[twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html){:target="_blank"} of the
Agile Manifesto, the original reason our movement was called *Agile*.
Some of us were also inspired by
[a realistic and useful vision of Scrum](a-realistic-and-useful-vision-of-scrum/){:target="_blank"}.
But _Agile_ and _Scrum_ are usually twisted to mean
something incompatible with this prior intent, especially in
organizations that are bigger than one team.

Traditional organizations will not gain agility with the _change
theater_ that is often sold as "Agile."  Change theater is actively
counterproductive, innoculating organizations against the structural
and policy changes they would need.

Agile organizations learn, reprioritize, and adapt to changing
customer needs, rather than focusing on output.

Even when many teams are involved, adaptability can be fine-grained,
 on a timescale of a week to a month rather than limited to coarse
 multi-month program increments and quarterly goals.
 
In knowledge work, "dependencies" are not caused by immutable laws of
physics.  The perceived need to plan around them through multiple
Sprints is a symptom of organizational structure and policy flaws
which should be directly addressed rather than institutionalized with
the waterfall dependency management that masquerades as Agile scaling.
  
Team self management implies a simplified, disintermediated
organizational structure. Role-free teams coordinate directly with
other teams and learn directly from customer interaction.  Please stop
rebadging traditional specifiers and coordinators with Agile-sounding
names.
  
Saying *yes* to agility means saying *no* to things that are mischaracterized as Agile: 
* eliminate processes not owned by teams,
* eliminate unnecessary intermediate layers and handoffs, (e.g. [people
  mislabeled "Product Owners" who actually own only one team instead of the
  whole Product](https://seattlescrum.com/downloads/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Organization-Very-Agile-Product-Owner-Misconceptions.pdf){:target="_blank"}) 
* eliminate unnecessary process-imposed role segregation (e.g. various kinds of crypto-project-managers) 
* eliminate software tools that affect the way teams manage their
Product Backlogs and Sprint Backlogs,
* eliminate the obsession with quantitative measures, 
* learn to detect other traditional practices relabeled and
  disguised as "Agile."

In 2001, when helping craft the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org){:target="_blank"}, Alistair Cockburn
made an observation that strikes us as important today:
> I am interested in fending off the fat methodology army, the
vast quantity of RUP, Anderson, SEI, etc. salespeople putting ideas
into CIOs' minds that they should have lots of paperwork to be "safe."
Countering the "I want a turnkey methodology, one that works straight
out of the box" mentality.  Those are the two battles I could use help in.

We support approaches such as LeSS that are based on fundamental Agile
principles because they can better serve customers and employees.  We
reject 'scaling' approaches that increase organizational complexity
and disempower teams.
