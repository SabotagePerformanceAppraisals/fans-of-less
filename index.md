# We Object To The Rampant Distortion Of Agile And Scrum.

We, the undersigned, are declaring a breakdown in the world of Agile
and Scrum. We love the [four values](https://agilemanifesto.org) and
[twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of the 
Agile Manifesto, the original reason our movement is called *Agile*.
Some of us were also inspired by
[an honest and useful vision of Scrum](/an-honest-and-useful-vision-of-scrum/). 
But today we feel that _Agile_ and _Scrum_ are usually distorted to 
mean something incompatible with their original intent. 

We believe that traditional
organizations will not gain agility with the superficial _change theater_ that
is often sold as "Agile."   Instead we advocate less process, fewer layers,
fewer roles, reduced use of "Agile tools" such as JIRA, less focus on
metrics, less traditional managment in disguise, and less 
hype.  We find this stuff to be actively
_counterproductive_, innoculating organizations against real change.

Organizations that want to truly serve their customers and employees
will benefit more from _de-scaling organizational complexity_, and
instead increasing skills, knowledge, and collaboration.  This
involves fundamental changes to organizational structure and policy
led both from the top and the bottom, with farther reaching
implications and a longer journey than many will expect.

* We believe in the competitive advantage of adaptability in order to
  discover and deliver on the highest end-customer value in a complex
  and turbulent environment rather than continuing to turn the screws
  on speed and resource efficiency. 

* We believe that no matter how many team are involved, adaptability of
 customer value can be fine-grained and on a timescale of a week to a
 month rather than limited to coarse multi-month program increments
 and quarterly goals.
 
* We believe in the many advantages of structuring teams around
  customer features and eliminating planning-time dependencies rather
  than components in the technology architecture and continuing
  batched planning with overlapping waterfall lifecycles to manage
  dependencies that could be eliminated.
  
* We believe in the adaptability advantages of a simplified,
  disintermediated organisational structure such that teams
  co-ordinate directly other teams and learn directly from customer
  interaction rather than rebadging the specifiers and co-ordinators.
  
* We believe in a true co-operative game involving business
  stakeholders and development rather than fixed incremental
  development within "The Contract Game" based on a scope and date
  contract born out of opposing interests.
  
* We believe in self-managing teams that own (not rent) their own
  processes and tools within agreed boundaries of interaction and
  transparency rather than being forced to conform to work management
  tools that force rigid processes and tools on teams. 

Thus we feel that lesser-known approaches that are explicit about this, such
as LeSS (and maybe even Nexus) represent a much needed change in our
industry.
