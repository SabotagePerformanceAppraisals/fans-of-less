title: An Honest and Useful Vision of Scrum (MJ's Perspective Only)
---
I first got interested in Scrum around the time Ken Schwaber published the first two books about it (one co-authored with Mike Beedle).  I was impressed that Ken admonished us not to present Scrum as a silver bullet.   Instead, we can use Scrum to reveal organizational faults so that management can fix them if they are brave enough to do it.  We were also advised that Scrum implies too much change for most organizations, but we should not water down the message just because changing organizations is hard. 

That is the Scrum I signed up to teach: _no silver bullet_.   I don't think I ever heard Ken talk about "velocity" or "hyperproductivity."
