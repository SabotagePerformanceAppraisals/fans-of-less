title: Why Join?

I (MJ) am a fan of LeSS because I have a finite lifespan and don't want to waste it on stuff that doesn't really make a difference, even if this would make it easier to get consulting and training work.  In a previous decade I was impressed by Ken Schwaber's admonition that Scrum will expose organizational issues that must be addressed by management if we are to make a difference.  LeSS is Scrum taught properly.

What will be your legacy when today's management fads die out?
