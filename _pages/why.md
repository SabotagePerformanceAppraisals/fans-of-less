I (MJ) am a fan of LeSS because I have a finite lifespan and don't
want to waste it on stuff that doesn't really make a difference, even
if this would make it easier to get consulting and training work.  In
a previous decade I was impressed by Ken Schwaber's admonition that
[Scrum will expose organizational issues that must be addressed by
management if we are to make a
difference](/a-realistic-and-useful-vision-of-scrum).

What will be your legacy when today's management fads die out?
