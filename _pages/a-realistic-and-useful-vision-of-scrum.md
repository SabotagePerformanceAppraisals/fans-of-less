title: A Realistic and Useful Vision of Scrum (MJ's Perspective Only)
---
I first got interested in Scrum around the time Ken Schwaber published the first two books about it (one co-authored with Mike Beedle).

I was impressed that Ken admonished us not to present Scrum as a silver bullet.   Instead, we can use Scrum to reveal organizational faults so that management can fix them if they are brave enough to do it: _Effort centers on the changes to the enterprise_.

We were also advised that Scrum implies more change than most organizations are ready for, but we should not water down the message just because changing organizations is hard: _The gap between current practices and target practices is a measure of incompetence and competitive risk._  The CSM class at that time had an exercise to reveal our own human tendency to make promises we can't keep: _These are habits that we aren't even aware of anymore._  We did not spend class time learning about Fibonacci numbers and I don't think I ever heard Ken talk about "velocity" or "hyperproductivity."  Ken told us _there is nothing new in Scrum_, and laughed at the idea that he or anyone else could have invented it. 

That is the Scrum I signed up to teach: _no silver bullet_.   

Scrum's mechanics are not particularly important or necessary for all teams, but there is something to the idea that a simple set of rules can help a team and organization discover where change is needed, something to the idea of a Scrum Master helping change the organization to allow team self management and focus on the top priority work.  Those are good things.

We don't need to oversell it.
