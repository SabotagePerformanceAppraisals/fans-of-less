If you are at Agile 2019, your tote bag should contain a small blue
comic book entitled
[_Why Scrum Isn't Making Your Organization Very Agile: Misconceptions About The Product Owner Role, And What To Do About Them_](https://seattlescrum.com/downloads/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Organization-Very-Agile-Product-Owner-Misconceptions.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
This is based on a video which was
[endorsed](https://twitter.com/TotherAlistair/status/1136145401311088640)
by our hero Alistair Cockburn.  Please dig this out of your bag and
share it with your colleagues.
