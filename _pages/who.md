## Volunteers
Manoj Vadakkan started Fans Of LeSS for the Austin Scrum Gathering in 2019 as a countermeasure to the big-box methdology and tools salesmen typically found exhibiting at Agile conferences.  I (MJ) quickly volunteered.  We set up a booth at the conference and got help from other volunteers such as Gene Gendel, Manjit Singh, and Rowan Bunning.  (If I left anyone out, please contact me and I'll add you.)

## Supporters
Andreas Schliep declared the Fans of LeSS booth to be the coolest one at the gathering.  Of course we had a visit from Howard Sublett of the Scrum Alliance.  Other fans of LeSS -- mostly practitioners -- that I hadn't met before came over to talk.  People told us about being forced to do big-box "Agile Scaling" frameworks but wanting a more principled approach.  Juan Banda encouraged us to represent our beliefs at Agile 2019 and introduced us to Phil Brock at the Agile Alliance, who has helped to accomodate us.

## LeSS Company Sponsorship
The LeSS Company founders Craig Larman and Bas Vodde are active software developers/coaches who haven't put much effort into marketing LeSS.  We've asked them to pay our expenses for Fans Of LeSS promotional activities, but not our time.
